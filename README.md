Algorithm to localizate incipient faults in insulated power cables
The Incipient Fault Locator in Power Cables using Metallic Sheaths provides a high-precision method for detecting and pinpointing incipient faults in the metallic sheaths of single-bonded underground cables. By measuring currents and voltages, this tool offers a reliable solution for continuous fault monitoring and localization.

The tool applies advanced impedance-based methods to calculate fault locations and works efficiently with data extracted from the metallic sheath parameters, significantly improving fault detection accuracy and reducing interference from external factors.

Functionality:

Accurately calculates fault locations along underground cable sheaths.
Measures currents and voltages in both grounded and ungrounded systems.
Optimized for real-time and on-line fault detection.
Reduces reliance on complex fault resistance assumptions.
Enhances the precision of fault detection and minimizes false alarms.
This tool supports the implementation of algorithms that provide reliable fault detection and localization results in complex electrical systems, aiding the diagnosis and maintenance of underground power distribution networks.

Installation and Usage:

Please refer to the documentation in the /docs directory for installation instructions and detailed usage guidelines.
